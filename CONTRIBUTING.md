## Welcome to JuSt Chess!

So, you want to contribute to the project. Here's some things you should know first:

- This project uses a CSS library called [Bulma](https://bulma.io). You should be familiar with it, as it will make it easier for you to understand the structure and look of the project and implement new features.
- Take a look at the currently deployment of the app. It's its last working version and it should help you find bugs and enhancement opportunities.
- Look at the current issues. You found a bug that isn't listed there? Create a new issue explaining the steps to recreate the bug. The issue is already listed and you want to fix it? Perfect! Comment on it saying that you will try to, and fork the repository. When making the PR, reference this issue so it's easy to know what PR fixes what issue.
- The repo is always open to new changes and we can talk on gitter [here](https://gitter.im/just-chess). You can come and ask if you have any doubt about any function or issue.

With all that present, you should be set and ready to start contributing. Happy coding!
